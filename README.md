# Llama 3.1 + Unsloth 2x Faster Finetuning

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook (`Llama_3_1_8b_+_Unsloth_2x_faster_finetuning.ipynb`) details the implementation and experimentation of fine-tuning the Llama 3.1 model using the Unsloth method for a 2x speed improvement. The notebook includes all steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, along with commentary on the results and optimization techniques.

## Key Features
- **Model**: Llama 3.1 with 8 billion parameters.
- **Optimization**: Unsloth method applied to achieve 2x faster training.
- **Data Processing**: Steps to preprocess and prepare the dataset for fine-tuning.
- **Training**: Code to fine-tune the Llama 3.1 model using custom hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and methods used to assess model performance post fine-tuning.
- **Visualization**: Charts and graphs to visualize training progress and results.

## Prerequisites
- **Python Version**: Ensure you are using Python 3.x.
- **Dependencies**: All required Python libraries are mentioned within the notebook. You can install them using `pip` or `conda`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
- **Clone the repository** or download the notebook.
- **Prepare your environment** by installing the necessary dependencies.
- **Run the notebook** step by step to replicate the fine-tuning process.

## Results
The notebook includes detailed results from the fine-tuning process, including comparisons of model performance before and after applying the Unsloth optimization. The results section highlights key improvements in training time and model accuracy.
